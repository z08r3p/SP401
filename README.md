6.      In   the   pandemic’s   earliest   months, European   countries   generally   invested   in   parental   welfare through paid   leave   schemes.   However,   Portugal   restricted   its paid leave   welfare provision
while   it   expanded   provision   across   many   other   domains. (Daly    Ryu   2023)   In   this   statement, Portugal   is   an   example   of   a(n)   …a.      Typical   case       b.      Deviant   case    c.      Extreme   case   d.      Diverse case

7.      In   Quebec,   neighbourhoods   where   parents   compete   for   limited   childcare   slots   generally   suffer   worse   childcare   quality. Poor   neighbourhoods   with   limited   childcare   slots   display   both
low   and   high   childcare   quality. (Chandler    Dilmaghani   2023)
In   this   statement, poor   neighbourhoods   are   an   example   of   a(n)   …a.      Typical   case       b.      Deviant   case    c.      Extreme   case   d.      Diverse case

8.    Economic   crises   usually produce   uniform   dissatisfaction   with   healthcare provision.   But   in   Ireland,   an      economic   crisis   produced   uneven      dissatisfaction    with   healthcare   provision:   ideologically         right-leaning         survey         respondents         were         much         more         dissatisfied         than   ideologically   left-leaning   respondents.

9.    Healthcare   mobilisation   was   particularly   fast   in   India, which   spurred   subnational   institutions in   Brazil   and   the   USA   to   follow   suit.   (Greer   et   al. 2022)

10.Although   electoral   strategy   determined   politicians’   willingness   to   enact   police   reform   in   Brazil   and   Argentina,   police   reform   never   materialised   in   Colombia   despite   its   electoral   promise. (González   2019)
In   this   statement, Colombia   is   an   example   of   a(n)   …

SECTION II (20 POINTS)
Look   at   the   following   chart   showing   response   rates   to   the   UK   Labour   Force   Survey   (LFS).
Notes. Initial interviews are sought from cohorts of eligible in-scope households   in each quarter of the year. (The   horizontal axis shows year-quarter.) Response rates refer to the fraction of eligible   in-scope households   in   Great   Britain   that   provide   an   interview   each   year-quarter   (and   exclude   imputed   cases).   Interviews   are   sought   from   households   at fve ‘waves’: the frst   round of   interviews   per cohort   is Wave   1,   and   further   interviews   are   sought   with   the   same   households   at   each   of   the   next   four   quarters   (Waves   2–5).   The   Total   response   rate   is   the   response rate averaged across all waves at each year-quarter.

13.   Write   a   short   commentary   (up   to   5   sentences   maximum)   about   the   implications   of   the   response rate trends for the reliability of quantitative research based on the   LFS.      (5   Marks)
14.   How   might   the   UK   ONS   address   the   issues   associated   with   non-response   in   the   LFS   to   get reliable statistics about the UK labour market? (Write up to 6 sentences   maximum.)      (6   Marks)
15.   Provide   THREE   examples   of   administrative   record   data.                                                                      (3 Marks)
SECTION III (20 POINTS)Imagine   that   all   seven   members   of   the   SP401   Teaching   Team   conducted   a   multi-researcher ethnography   during   Welcome   Week   in   September   2023. As   part   of   that   research   activity,   the instructors participated in the   Welcome   Week activities and spoke to members of   the incoming代 写SP401 - Understanding Policy Research 2023/24Java
代做程序编程语言   MSc   cohort   — yes,   that’s   you!   — and   the   instructors   conferred   together   about   their   notes   each evening.

SECTION IV (40 POINTS)In   a   recent   randomized   control   trial   conducted   in   a   suburban   school   district, researchers   aimed to assess the impact of   modern technological interventions on student math performance. Two   hundred   students   in   the   10th   grade   were   randomly   assigned   to   either   a   treatment   group   or   a   control group.   The treatment group received tablets loaded   with   interactive   math   software   that   adapted   to   each   student's   learning   pace   and   provided   instant   feedback.   In   contrast,   the   control group continued   with traditional textbook methods.   The intervention   lasted   for   a   full   academic   year.   At   the   end   of   the   year,   both   groups   took   a   standardized   math   exam   to   measure   their   performance.24.    What   was   the   primary   objective   of   the   RCT   conducted   in   the   suburban   school   district?   In your answer, be sure to specify the independent variable and the dependent variable.      (3   Marks)
25.    How   did the   learning   resources   differ   between the   treatment   and   control   groups   in   the   suburban   school   RCT?                           (2 Marks)

30.   With      specific      reference      to      the      suburban      school      RCT,       describe      two         methodological   limitations   of   RCTs.                          (4 Marks)A mayor introduces a programme throughout   her city   that provides   job   training   for people   who   have   been   unemployed   longer   than   six   months. Two   years   after   the   programme   commenced, the city’s   ten   neighbourhoods   have   reported   divergent   unemployment   trajectories: the   eight   smallest   neighbourhoods         have            reported         huge            reductions         in            unemployment;       the            two         largest   neighbourhoods      have      reported      small      increases      in      unemployment.    Nonetheless,    the      mayor   arranges      a      press      conference      during      which      she      celebrates      city-wide      success      in      reducing unemployment, and   she   attributes   the   reduction   to   the   training   programme   she   introduced.
31.   Does   logical   causation   support the   mayor’s   inference that the training   programme was   successful? Justify   your   answer   in   one   sentence.                                                                                                       (2 Marks)
32. Which      set-theoretic      research      design      describes      a      comparison      of      the      unemployment trajectories between   the   ten neighbourhoods   that received   the   training programme; ‘most-   similar systems’ or ‘most-different systems’? Justify your answer in one sentence.      (2   Marks)
33.   Is   a   neighbourhood’s   small   size   a   necessary   condition   of   the   programme’s   success?   Justify   your   answer   in   one   sentence.                          (2 Marks)
34.   Describe   and   differentiate   between the   following   approaches to   evidence   synthesis:   (i)   systematic   review; (ii) rapid   review   assessment; and   (iii)   meta-analysis?                               (5 marks)
35.   “It’s not possible   to synthesize evidence   from qualitative research.”   To   what extent do   you   agree   or   disagree   with   this   statement? Give   reasons   for   your   argument(s). (4 marks)

36. A team of   researchers hypothesises that introducing a   new   interactive   teaching   module   in   elementary schools   will significantly enhance the   mathematical   abilities   of students.   They   decide   to   test   the   effectiveness   of   this   module   by   assessing   the   students'   math   scores   before implementing   the module and then   comparing   those scores   to   the   scores   obtained   after   a   year   of   using   the   module.
This research design can best be described as which of the following:
a.      A randomized controlled trial
b.      A   quasi-experiment
c.      A pre-post design with no comparison group
d.      A correlational research design
e.      None   of   the   above                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  (1 Mark)

38. A         team         of      researchers         hypothesised       that      planting         community      gardens       in         urban   neighbourhoods   would   lead   to   improved   dietary   habits   among   residents. They   noted   that   the recent         establishment         of         community         playgrounds         was         closely         associated         with         a   neighbourhood’s   decision   to   plant   a   garden,   but   wasn't   directly   related   to   dietary   habits   except   through   the   presence   of   a    community   garden.    The      team      used      the      variation      in playground   establishment   to   measure   the   local   average   treatment   effect   of   community   garden   planting   on   dietary   habits.

40. A   team   of   researchers   posited   that   exposure   to   information   and   role   models   could   diminish gender-based   implicit   bias.   They   randomly   selected   thirty   undergraduate   students   to   be   exposed      to    these      informational      sessions      and   role   models,    while    another   set    of   thirty   undergraduates      from   the   same   university   went   through   standard   orientation   exercises.   Subsequently,   all   sixty   participants   took   an   implicit   bias      test,   and   the      outcomes    were   juxtaposed   and   evaluated.
